About
=====

Nimfa is a Python scripting library which includes a number of published matrix factorization algorithms, initialization methods, quality and performance measures and 
facilitates the combination of these to produce new strategies. The library represents a unified and efficient interface to matrix factorization algorithms and methods.

The nimfa library works with numpy dense matrices and scipy sparse matrices (where this is possible to save on space). The library has support for multiple runs of the algorithms which can be used 
for some quality measures. By setting runtime specific options tracking the residuals error within one (or more) run or tracking fitted factorization model is possible. 
Extensive documentation with working examples which demonstrate real applications, commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help with the 
interpretation and comprehension of the results.

Nimfa library is a result of the Google Summer of Code 2011 program by the `Orange`_ organization.
