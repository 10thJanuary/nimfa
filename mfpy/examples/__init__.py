    This package contains examples of usage of MF library. It demonstrates the following:
        
        #. Single run of the specified factorization algorithm.
        #. Multiple runs of the specified factorization algorithm.
        #. Tracking fitted results across multiple runs and tracking residuals error across single/mutliple runs.
        #. Quality and performance measures of executed factorizations.
        #. Running factorization algorithms with algorithm specific settings and initializations.
