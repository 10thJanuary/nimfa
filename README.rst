MF is a Python scripting library which includes a number of published matrix factorization algorithms, initialization methods, quality and performance measures and facilitates the combination of these to produce new strategies. The library represents a unified and efficient interface to matrix factorization algorithms and methods.

Extensive documentation with working examples which demonstrate real applications, commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help with the interpretation and comprehension of the results.

Project wiki is at http://orange.biolab.si/trac/wiki/MatrixFactorization. MF is a result of the Google Summer of Code 2011 program by the `Orange`_ organization.
